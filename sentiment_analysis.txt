i. The scores provided in the 'sentiment' column are the output of NLTK's pre-trained VADER sentiment intensity analyzer. The VADER model is sensitive to both polarity and intensity of emotion within text. The analyzer outputs four scores: positive, neutral, negative, and compound. The compound score represents the combined pos/neg scores after normalization. A compound score of -1 represents maximum negative emotion and a compound score of 1 represents maximum positive emotion. VADER is based on dictionary mapping of lexical features to emotion intensities (sentiment scores.)

ii. Although the VADER model is trained on more casual and conversational English, I believe that it applies reasonably well to the legal language used in the case texts. However, sentiment score accuracy could be improved. I chose VADER because it is simple and the method of sentiment analysis I have the most experience with. VADER should be replaced with another pre-trained sentiment analyzer, like TextBlob, which handles formal language better. Or, better yet, a regression model could be trained from scratch to generate more domain-relevant scores. But, this would require more data.
